This is just a collection of my experiments in generative audio in Dart.  
There's not really any documentation but feel free to play with any of this stuff or use it in your (open source) projects.  
Some of this stuff might make it into a pub package at some point, do let me know if any of this is useful and if you might find use for it in a more structured form.

Scripts are in the `bin` folder.
